Hi, I'm @bassios, or Mike in real life.
My GitHub is a bit bare, a lot of my projects are private as they're all just stuff I've been messing about with whilst I've been learning.

Some of the things I've been working on in my spare time include a POS (Point Of Sale) app for my parents' shop (which needs heavy re-writes as I've learnt more) and a Pen & Paper RPG combat initiative tracker. That'll be on here soon.
